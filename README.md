# The-2048-Game
This game is a console-based implementation of the popular puzzle game which was released in 2014. The game 
begins with an empty 4x4 board, and the player's goal is to reach the tile with the value of 2048 by combining 
adjacent tiles of the same value.

The game features four main movements: left, right, up, and down, which are triggered by the 'a', 'd', 'w', and 's' keys respectively. 
The game displays the current state of the board and the player's score after each move. The player continues making moves until the game 
board is filled, and there are no adjacent tiles with the same value or until the player reaches the 2048 tile.
